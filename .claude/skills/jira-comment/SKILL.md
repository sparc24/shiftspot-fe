# Jira Comment Skill

Adds a comment to a Jira issue. Called by the Orchestrator after the ticket is transitioned to Done, to record the Confluence LLD link.

---

## Trigger Point

The Orchestrator MUST invoke this skill after Step 4 (Rebase Health) clears and the ticket has been transitioned to Done (via Jira Status Skill) — not by Unit Test Agent directly, since Rebase Health runs after Unit Test Agent finishes.

---

## Input

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TicketId` | string | Yes | Jira issue key (e.g. `US-123`) |
| `ConfluenceUrl` | string | No | Confluence LLD page URL — omit if not available |
| `ConfluenceTitle` | string | No | Human-readable title of the LLD page (e.g. `US-123-Add-User-Profile-Web`) |
| `AdditionalNotes` | string | No | Any extra context to append to the comment body |

---

## Comment Body Format

```
✅ Implementation complete and tests passed.

LLD: [<ConfluenceTitle>](<ConfluenceUrl>)

<AdditionalNotes if provided>
```

If `ConfluenceUrl` is absent, omit the LLD line entirely.

---

## Steps

```
mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue
  issueKey: <TicketId>
  comment: <formatted comment body>
```

---

## Output

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `Status` | `Added` \| `Failed` |
| `TicketId` | The issue key that was commented on |
| `Error` | Populated only on `Failed` — the raw API error message |

Report the result back to the Orchestrator in the conversation.

---

## Error Handling

- If `addCommentToJiraIssue` returns an error → set `Status: Failed`, report `Error`. A comment failure must not block the GitHub PR Skill — the workflow continues.

---

## Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue` | Post the comment to the Jira issue |
