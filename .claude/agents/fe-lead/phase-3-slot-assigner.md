# Sprint Slot Assigner

**Project config**: Read `.claude/context/project-config.md` before executing. Use the **Workflow Track Detection** section for fix version keywords, the **File Paths** section for shared file patterns, and the **Sprint Team** section for the developer list.

Reads the fetch output and analysis output, builds the dependency graph, identifies Foundation stories, detects shared file conflicts, assigns stories to slots, and balances the workload across team members. All team members are treated as senior developers with equivalent productivity — assignment is driven entirely by workload balance.

No external MCP calls — this agent works entirely from the fetched and analysed data.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the inputs

Read:
- `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-fetch-output.yml` — story data, Jira links, HLD signals
- `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-analysis-output.yml` — estimation hours, readiness, carry-over flags

If either file is missing, stop with the appropriate message.

---

### Step 2: Build the dependency graph

For each story, determine dependencies using four sources in descending priority. Record each as:
`{ from, to, reason, source: "jira|confluence|keyword|description", confidence: "High|Medium|Low" }`

**Source 1 — Jira issue links (weight 4)**
- `A blocks B` → B depends_on A
- `A is blocked by B` → A depends_on B
- Confidence: High

**Source 2 — Confluence HLD ordering signals (weight 3)**
- Parse `orderingSignals` from the fetch output
- Match ticket IDs or summary keywords to sprint stories
- Confidence: Medium

**Source 3 — Summary keyword ordering within the same feature area (weight 2)**

Apply only to stories sharing a noun in their summaries (same feature area):

| Summary keywords | Position |
|-----------------|----------|
| `list`, `listing`, `grid`, `view all`, `overview` | 1 — earliest |
| `create`, `add`, `new`, `register` | 2 |
| `edit`, `update`, `modify`, `change` | 3 |
| `delete`, `remove`, `archive`, `deactivate` | 4 |
| `report`, `export`, `dashboard`, `summary` | 5 |

Story at position 1 → stories at positions 2–5 in the same feature area depend on it.
Confidence: Medium for same-feature matches, Low for uncertain groupings.

**Source 4 — Description cross-references (weight 1)**
- Scan each story's description for mentions of other sprint ticket IDs
- Confidence: Low

Consolidate duplicates — a dependency found in multiple sources gets the highest confidence level.

---

### Step 3: Identify Foundation stories

A story qualifies as **Foundation** if ANY of these are true:
1. Two or more other sprint stories depend on it
2. Its summary is at keyword position 1 AND at least one story in the same feature area is at position 2+
3. It has the most inbound cross-references

Multiple Foundation stories in the same feature area are sequential — order them in dependency chain. If no clear Foundation exists, skip the Foundation slot.

---

### Step 4: Detect shared file conflicts and assign slots

**Infer shared files each story will modify:**

| Position | Likely shared files modified |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 (listing) | `*-interfaces.ts`, `use*Queries.ts`, `*-service.ts` — creates them |
| 2 (create) | `*-interfaces.ts` (form type), `use*Queries.ts` (mutation), `*-tabs.ts` |
| 3 (edit) | `*-interfaces.ts` (edit type), `use*Queries.ts` (mutation), `*-tabs.ts` |
| 4 (delete) | `use*Queries.ts` (delete mutation) |
| 5 (export) | `use*Queries.ts` (new query) |
| Bug fix | No shared file conflicts unless summary/description says otherwise |

Two stories conflict when both modify the same shared file AND are in the same feature folder.

**Slot assignment rules:**
1. **Foundation slot** — Foundation stories in dependency order
2. **Numbered slots 1, 2, 3...** — group conflicting stories in the same slot; order by dependency within each slot; stories from different feature folders never conflict

For each slot, compute:
- `totalStoryPoints` (null → 0 in sum; flag separately)
- `totalEstimatedHours` (from analysis output)
- `storiesWithNoEstimate` — count where `storyPoints` is null

---

### Step 5: Determine workflow type per story

Use fix version keywords from **Workflow Track Detection** in `project-config.md`:
- `Bug` + beta keyword + priority Highest/Critical → `hotfix`
- `Bug` + beta keyword → `beta-bugfix`
- `Bug` + pilot keyword or empty → `bugfix`
- `Story|Task` + beta keyword → `beta-feature`
- `Story|Task` + pilot keyword or empty → `feature`

---

### Step 6: Assign developers to stories

All team members have equivalent productivity. Distribute stories across the team to balance `estimatedHours` as evenly as possible.

**Assignment algorithm:**
1. Start with Foundation slot stories — assign all to the developer with the most available hours (they must start first; others are blocked until Foundation merges)
2. For each remaining slot, assign the entire slot to one developer where possible (they own a coherent stream)
3. If a slot's `totalEstimatedHours` exceeds one developer's remaining capacity, split the slot across two developers — split at a natural story boundary where there is no shared file dependency between the two halves
4. After assignment, compute each developer's `assignedHours` and `remainingCapacityHours`
5. Flag any developer whose `assignedHours > capacityHours` as `overloaded: true`

Record the assigned developer (`assignedTo`, `assignedJiraUsername`) for each story.

### Step 7: Produce output

Write to `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-slots-output.yml`:
