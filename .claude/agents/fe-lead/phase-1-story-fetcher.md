# Sprint Story Fetcher

**Project config**: Read `.claude/context/project-config.md` before executing. Use the **File Paths** section for the sprint plan working file directory, the **Project Identity** section for the Jira ticket prefix, and the **Sprint Team** section for the team member list and sprint capacity.

Fetches all stories in a sprint from Jira, retrieves epic HLD pages from Confluence, checks each story's requirements source and acceptance criteria quality, detects carry-over stories from the previous sprint, and records team composition and capacity. Produces the structured dataset consumed by the Lead Analysis agent.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Fetch sprint metadata and all stories

Fetch the sprint object for `{SPRINT_ID}` via Atlassian MCP. Extract:
- `sprintName` — human-readable name (e.g. `"Sprint 15"`)
- `sprintState` — active / closed / future
- `startDate` and `endDate` — if available

Fetch all stories using JQL:
```
sprint = {SPRINT_ID} AND issuetype in (Story, Task, Bug) ORDER BY created ASC
```

For each story, collect:
- `ticketId` — e.g. `PROJ-1234`
- `summary` — ticket title
- `issueType` — Story / Task / Bug
- `status` — current Jira status
- `fixVersion` — first fix version name, or empty
- `storyPoints` — numeric value or `null` if unset
- `priority` — Highest / High / Medium / Low / Lowest
- `assignee` — Jira user display name, or empty if unassigned
- `description` — full text content
- `acceptanceCriteria` — content of the Acceptance Criteria field if it exists as a separate Jira field; otherwise extract AC-like lines from the description (lines starting with "AC:", "Given/When/Then", numbered lists that look like criteria)
- `jiraLinks` — array of `{ type: "blocks"|"is blocked by"|"relates to", linkedTicketId }` — only include links to tickets also in this sprint
- `figmaUrl` — any Figma URL found in the description or remote links
- `confluenceUrl` — any Confluence page URL found in the description or remote links
- `epicLink` — parent epic ticket ID, if present
- `labels` — array of label strings

If no stories are returned, stop: "No stories found in sprint {SPRINT_ID}. Verify the sprint ID is correct."

---

### Step 2: Assess requirements source per story

For each story, determine where the implementation requirements come from:

| Condition | `requirementsSource` |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Has a `figmaUrl` | `figma` |
| Has a `confluenceUrl` (and no figmaUrl) | `confluence` |
| No Figma or Confluence link but `description` has ≥3 acceptance criteria or ≥100 words of substantive content | `inline` |
| None of the above | `missing` |

A `requirementsSource` of `missing` does **not** block the sprint — it is flagged for the lead's attention in Phase 2. Requirements written directly in the story body are fully valid; mark them as `inline`.

---

### Step 3: Assess acceptance criteria quality per story

For each story, evaluate the ACs:

- `acCount` — number of distinct acceptance criteria found
- `acQuality`:
  - `specific` — each AC is testable (contains an action and a verifiable outcome)
  - `vague` — ACs are present but written in general terms ("should work correctly", "must be user-friendly")
  - `missing` — no ACs found at all

Bug tickets with a clear description of reproduce steps and expected behaviour count as having implicit ACs — mark them `specific` if the reproduce steps are clear.

---

### Step 4: Detect carry-over stories from the previous sprint

Fetch the sprint immediately before `{SPRINT_ID}` using Atlassian MCP:
```
JQL: sprint in openSprints() OR sprint in closedSprints() ORDER BY startDate DESC
```
Find the sprint whose `endDate` is closest before this sprint's `startDate` — that is the previous sprint.

Fetch its stories:
```
JQL: sprint = {PREVIOUS_SPRINT_ID} AND issuetype in (Story, Task, Bug)
```

For each ticket in the current sprint, check if its `ticketId` appears in the previous sprint's story list. If yes, mark `isCarryOver: true`. Record the previous sprint's name for reporting.

If the previous sprint cannot be fetched (first sprint, API error), continue silently — set `isCarryOver: false` for all stories and note `previousSprintAvailable: false` in the output.

---

### Step 5: Fetch epic-level Confluence HLD pages

For each unique epic ticket ID found across the sprint stories:

1. Fetch the epic via Atlassian MCP
2. Extract Confluence page URLs from the epic's description and remote links
3. Fetch each Confluence page
4. Extract ordering signals: section headers with ticket IDs, sequence phrases ("before", "after", "depends on", "phase 1/2/3", "prerequisite", "followed by"), numbered implementation steps

If no epics or no Confluence pages are found, note this clearly in the output — the slot assigner will fall back to keyword and description analysis.

---

### Step 6: Read team composition from project config

Read the **Sprint Team** table from `project-config.md`. Extract:
- `name` — developer display name
- `jiraUsername` — Jira username for assignee write-back
- `capacityHours` — sprint capacity in hours

Compute `teamTotalCapacityHours` = sum of all developers' `capacityHours`.

---

### Step 7: Produce output

Write to `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-fetch-output.yml`:

```yaml
sprintId: "{SPRINT_ID}"
sprintName: "Sprint 15"
sprintState: active
startDate: "2026-05-19"
endDate: "2026-06-01"
fetchedAt: "<ISO timestamp>"
previousSprintAvailable: true
previousSprintId: "12344"
previousSprintName: "Sprint 14"
teamTotalCapacityHours: 180
teamMembers:
  - name: "Developer 1"
    jiraUsername: "dev1.name"
    capacityHours: 60

  - ticketId: PROJ-XXXX
    summary: "..."
    issueType: Story

    fixVersion: "0.4.1 Pilot F1"
    storyPoints: 5
    priority: Medium
    assignee: "Jane Smith"
    description: "..."
    acceptanceCriteria: "..."
    acCount: 3
    acQuality: specific
    requirementsSource: figma
    figmaUrl: "https://..."
    confluenceUrl: ""
    isCarryOver: false
    labels: []
    jiraLinks:
      - type: blocks
        linkedTicketId: PROJ-YYYY
    epicLink: PROJ-ZZZZ
confluenceHLDs:
  - epicId: PROJ-ZZZZ
    pageUrl: "https://..."
    pageTitle: "..."
    orderingSignals:
      - "Listing screen (PROJ-XXXX) must complete before Create/Edit screens"
confluenceAvailable: true
```

Report:
```

  Carry-over from {previousSprintName}: {N} stories
  Requirements source: {N} figma | {N} confluence | {N} inline | {N} missing
