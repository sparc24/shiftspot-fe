**Role**: You are a Frontend Senior Lead.

# Phase 2 — Lead Analysis

**Project config**: Read `.claude/context/project-config.md` before executing. Use the **Estimation Baseline** section for hours-per-component tables, the **Sprint Team** section for team capacity, and the **Tech Stack** section to understand which components are relevant for each story type.

Reads the Story Fetcher output and performs three responsibilities a senior frontend lead carries out before sprint kickoff:
1. **Story readiness review** — flags stories that need attention before coding begins
2. **Technical estimation** — breaks each story into implementation components and estimates hours from a senior developer perspective
3. **Sprint capacity check** — compares committed hours to team capacity and flags over-commitment

No external MCP calls — this agent works entirely from the fetch output and project config.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the fetch output

Read `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-fetch-output.yml`.

If missing, stop: "Fetch output not found. Run the Story Fetcher agent first."

Also read the **Estimation Baseline** and **Sprint Team** sections from `project-config.md`.

---

### Step 2: Story readiness assessment

For each story, assess readiness using the criteria below. A story can be `ready`, `needs-attention`, or `blocked`.

**Flag as `needs-attention` if ANY of these are true:**
- `requirementsSource` is `missing` — no Figma, Confluence, or sufficient inline description found
- `acQuality` is `vague` — ACs are too general to drive implementation or testing
- `acCount` is 0 and `issueType` is not `Bug` — stories with no ACs at all
- `storyPoints` is `null` — unestimated story; scope is unknown
- `storyPoints > 8` — story is likely too large to complete in one sprint; recommend splitting

**Flag as `blocked` if ANY of these are true:**
- `isCarryOver: true` AND `status` is still `To Do` — a story that didn't move at all last sprint is a risk signal
- A Jira `blocks` or `is blocked by` link points to a ticket **not in this sprint** — external blocker

**Otherwise:** `readinessStatus: ready`

For each `needs-attention` or `blocked` story, produce a `readinessNotes` list explaining exactly what is missing. Be specific — the lead will use these notes to chase the product owner or designer before kickoff.

Examples:
- "No acceptance criteria. Ask the product owner to add testable ACs before sprint starts."
- "Story is 13 points — likely too large for one sprint. Consider splitting into listing + create/edit stories."
- "No Figma or Confluence link. Verify requirements are complete in the story description."
- "Carry-over from Sprint 14 and still To Do — investigate why it didn't move last sprint."
- "Blocked by PROJ-9999 which is not in this sprint — confirm backend dependency timeline."

---

### Step 3: Technical estimation per story

For each story, produce a detailed hour-by-hour breakdown using the **Estimation Baseline** table from `project-config.md`.

**Determine the complexity tier:**
- Bug tickets → use Bug fix table from Estimation Baseline directly
- `storyPoints ≤ 3` → Low tier
- `storyPoints ≤ 8` → Medium tier
- `storyPoints > 8` → High tier
- `storyPoints` null → treat as Medium, note `estimatedFromComplexity: true`

**For Story/Task tickets, sum the applicable components:**
- Include all rows from the tier table
- Omit `Validation Schema` if the story has no form (listing-only or delete-only stories)
- Omit `Zustand Store` unless the story description or HLD explicitly mentions new state management
- Omit `Sub-components` for simple single-screen stories (listing or delete only)
- Round the total to the nearest 0.5 hour

**Comparison to Jira story points:**
- Expected hours = `storyPoints × 2` (from velocity reference: 1 SP ≈ 2 hours)
- If estimated total is more than 50% above the expected hours → `mismatchFlag: true`, `mismatchDirection: "underestimated"`
- If estimated total is more than 30% below the expected hours → `mismatchFlag: true`, `mismatchDirection: "overestimated"`
- Otherwise → `mismatchFlag: false`

Include a one-sentence `estimationNote` explaining the estimate (e.g. "Standard medium-complexity screen — estimate aligns with 5 story points." or "Estimate suggests this may be underestimated; consider re-pointing before sprint starts.").

---

### Step 4: Sprint capacity check

Compute:
- `totalEstimatedHours` = sum of all story `estimatedHours` in the sprint
- `teamTotalCapacityHours` = from fetch output (read from project-config.md team section)
- `utilizationPercent` = `(totalEstimatedHours / teamTotalCapacityHours) × 100`
- `bufferHours` = `teamTotalCapacityHours − totalEstimatedHours`

**Capacity status:**
- `utilizationPercent ≤ 85%` → `capacityStatus: healthy` — sprint is within capacity
- `85% < utilizationPercent ≤ 100%` → `capacityStatus: tight` — sprint is full; no room for unexpected issues
- `utilizationPercent > 100%` → `capacityStatus: over-committed` — sprint exceeds team capacity; recommend removing stories

Produce a `capacityNote` summarising the situation in one sentence.

Also produce a `carryOverNote` if any carry-over stories were detected: "X stories carried over from {previousSprintName}. Review with product owner whether scope should be adjusted before committing to this sprint."

### Step 5: Produce output

Write to `.claude/output/sprint-plan/.{SPRINT_ID}-analysis-output.yml`:
